## Camera: Gain and Exposure Requirements
The following table includes requirements for my part. You can see the team requirements [here](https://egr314-s-2026-304.github.io/03-Project-requirements/).

| **Requirement Description** | **Measure of<br> Threshold** | **Target<br>Measure** |**Stretch<br>Requirement<br>(Y-N)**|
|-----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------- | :-----: |
| Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulatore | 3.2 Volts | 3.3 Volts | No |
| Surface mounted microcontroller | 1 PIC or ESP | 8-bit PIC | No |
| Light Sensor | Able to sense light and report back to main board| Illuminance (lux) | No |
| Small Motors for Shutter | Able to open and close lens for light control, probably with mini stepper or mini brushless dc motor| Open and close lens | No |
|*The rest are items your modules need to support the task you are covering for the team's device.* | --- | --- | **NO** |
