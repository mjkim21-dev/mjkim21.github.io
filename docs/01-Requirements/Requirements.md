The following table includes requirements for my part. You can see the team project requirements [here](https://egr314-s-2026-304.github.io/03-Project-requirements/).

| **Requirement Description** | **Measure of<br> Threshold** | **Target<br>Measure** |**Stretch<br>Requirement<br>(Y-N)**|
|-----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------- | :-----: |
| Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulatore | 3.2 Volts | 3.3 Volts | No |
| Surface mounted microcontroller to read and send value to main | 1 PIC or ESP | 8-bit PIC | No |
| Light Sensor to measure desired luminance | Able to sense light and report back to main board| Illuminance (lux) | No |
