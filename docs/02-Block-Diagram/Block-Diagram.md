## Overview
The block diagram provides a high-level representation of the electrical architecture of the system and how each major subsystem interfaces with the ESP32 microcontroller. It illustrates power distribution, signal flow, and communication interfaces between sensors, actuators, and external connections. By identifying voltage levels, control methods (digital I/O, PWM, I²C), and pin usage, the diagram helps justify component selection and ensures compatibility across the system. Additionally, this block diagram serves as a reference for team integration by clearly indicating how this subsystem connects to other team members’ boards through shared power and digital interfaces.
